A1. 
- React is declarative and component based library that we used to build the user interface.
- By user interface we mean the elements that users see and interact with on-screen.
- By library we mean React provides helpful functions to build the UI, but leaves it up to us where to use those functions in our application.
- By declarative we mean that we only specify the React that what we want and we don't need to give the instructions to the React that How we want.

A2.
- Components are the building blocks of any react application, and a single app usually consists of multiple components.
- A component is essentially is a piece of the user interface. It splits the user interface into independent, reusable parts that can be processed separately.
- A component is a piece of the user interface that has its own logic and appearence.
